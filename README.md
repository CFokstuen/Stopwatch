**Stopwatch**

The stopwatch application provides a comprehensive set of functionalities to measure and track elapsed time. The core features include:

1. Timer Display: The stopwatch prominently displays the elapsed time in a clear and readable format, showing minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.

2. Start Function: Users can start the stopwatch by clicking the "Start" button, which initiates the timekeeping process. The elapsed time begins to increment in real-time.

3. Stop Function: The "Stop" button allows users to pause the stopwatch at any given moment. This feature is useful for temporarily halting the timekeeping when needed.

4. Reset Function: The "Reset" button enables users to reset the stopwatch to its initial state, clearing the elapsed time and resetting it to zero.

5. Lap Time Recording: The stopwatch provides a "Lap" button, which allows users to record and store multiple lap times while the stopwatch is running. Each recorded lap time represents the elapsed time at the moment the "Lap" button is clicked.

6. Lap Time Display: The recorded lap times are dynamically displayed in a dedicated section below the main stopwatch. The lap times are presented in a list format, showing the elapsed time for each recorded lap.

7. Lap Time Scrolling: If the number of recorded lap times exceeds the visible area, the lap time section automatically becomes scrollable. This ensures that users can easily view and access all the recorded lap times without any obstruction.

8. Clear Lap Times: The stopwatch includes a "Clear Lap Times" button, which allows users to remove all the recorded lap times from the display. This feature provides a convenient way to start fresh and clear the lap time history.

These functionalities collectively provide users with a comprehensive and intuitive stopwatch experience, enabling them to accurately measure and track elapsed time, record multiple lap times, and manage the recorded data effectively.
